This was the third project in the course "Datastrukturer och Algoritmer" (Datastructures and Algorithms). The task was to build a program that can guess the language of a given input among the 8 languages it knows (Germanic and Romance languages). The program analyzed a text in each languages and counted the distribution of single chars and triplet of chars along with the distribution of first letter characters. It then guesses with fair accuracy which language the user inputs, as long as the input is one of the languages the program knows. This was also a pair assignment, my role was the language analyzer and my pair made the UI-class(which is responsible for all output). The analyzer class only returns an Analysis object.

The reason for the 1 "initial commit" commit is because the project was built on a private repo issued by our lecturer.
